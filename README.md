# Studio 0

## Part 1: Markdown Practice

The first part of this studio is practice with Markdown. Complete each of the following exercises:

You can preview what your Markdown file will look like when styles are added by using Particle Desktop's Markdown Preview feature. To do so:
1. Go to the `Packages` Menu.
1. Select the `Markdown Preview` submenu.
1. Select `Toggle Preview` (You may also want to make a note of the shortcut keys listed so you can quickly open the preview in the future).

***Q1. The above paragraph and this sentence use markdown in a few ways.  Give a brief description of anything unusual you notice.  Just enter your description on the lines below:***

3 asterisks mean bold + italics   
this "1." creates an ordered list.  
`this` highlights items

### Lists

Create a numbered list of five of your favorite foods in-order from favorite to least favorite in the designated area below. Be sure to include at least two things that are made of multiple ingredients.  

For each item that has multiple ingredients, create a sub list of a few (2-5) of the ingredients.  Make one of the sub-lists numbered and the other should use bullet points. (It should look like an outline: The ingredients for item n are indented and immediately below item n, but before item n+1)

***Q2. Create your list here:***

1. Potato chips
  1. Potatoes
  2. Oil
1. Ice cream
1. Falafel
  * Chickpeas
  * Onions
  * garlic
1. Pasta
1. Lasagna

### Headings

Headings and sub-headings help separate the content of a document.

***Q3. Add a new third tier heading to this document named "My Heading" here:***

### My heading

### Code

Markdown is often used to document code.  Consequently, it supports embedding code within documents.

***Q4. Create a code block below and include a Java `for`-loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10. Be sure to indicate that it's Java, which will cause Java keywords to be highlighted (for example, depending on your configuration `for` may be purple in the preview window; `int` may be orange, etc.):***

```Java
for(int i = 0; i <=10; i++){
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

## Part 2: What is IoT

This class is about IoT.  [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/) has a list of examples of IoT.  Pick any three categories (Body, Home City, Industry, etc.) and review any one example of each.

***Q5.  Based on your reviews, create a table of the top four distinguishing features of IoT applications. One column of the table should have a brief name for the feature (1-4 words) and the second column should have an explanation:***

Feature Name | explanation
--------------|------------------
Connectivity | the application can have both digital and analog inputs
Interactivity | the application can interact with the user through sound or displays
Compactness | this is due to the fact that embedded devices often have limited cpu and memory
Communication | this means that different iot devices have to be able to talk to each other.

Search for some additional IoT examples at other sites and find two examples that you find interesting.

***Q6.  For each example: 1) provide a link to it, 2) provide a brief summary of it, and 3) explain how it corresponds to distinguishing features you identified above and/or or how you may want to revise your list of distinguishing features.  Use lists/sublists to format your answer to this question (A numbered list of 2 items, each of which as 3 sub-items):***

1. [Evolution of smart homes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewweinreich/2017/12/18/the-future-of-the-smart-home-smart-homes-iot-a-century-in-the-making/#bf4832657ac2): the article talks about one of the most well-known and easily identifiable applications of IoT, the smart home, and its evolution. the second-half of the article is dedicated to an interview with Prof. John Barrett on the future of IoT.
  * Revise "Interactivity": the interactivity feature need not necessarily be through displays, but, more importantly, can be through the internet/cloud.
  * Revise "Communication" in the sense that other IoT devices can talk with each other more if the data were stored in a cloud. Another option would be a private network but that would be limiting the usefulness.
1. [Flood Detection System](http://www.libelium.com/early-flood-detection-and-warning-system-in-argentina-developed-with-libelium-sensors-technology/): the case study talks about the implementation of a flood detection and warning system in Argentina, including the sensors involved, the communication protocols, and analytics.
  * Revise "Communication" in the sense that there might be multiple/redundant ways of communication.
  * "Connectivity" : the outputs from an IoT application might be on the cloud, in the form of a dashboard with big data analytics

## Part 3: Comparing with Peers

Compare your previous work with other people in the class and try to come to a consensus about what IoT is about.

***Q7. Meet someone new.  Find a class member who you don't already know and introduce yourself.  Compare your work conclusions to the above IoT questions. Again, using a list indicate: 1) Who you worked with, and 2) Any discrepancies or interesting observations that arise from comparing your work:***

  * Timon Brandl

***Q8. Meet someone else new.  Find another class member who you don't already know and introduce your self.  Again compare your work as before:***
